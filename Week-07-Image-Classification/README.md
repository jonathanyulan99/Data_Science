	* The story/motivation behind why you are doing this particular project.
	* A description of your data; Where you got it, how many rows/cols it is, and what the features are. 
	* For modeling projects: Your input features and your output prediction.
	* For classification modeling projects, your class balances.
	* For visualization project: Three rough sketches of what visualizations you are going to do and why you are choosing to do these visualizations. 
	* What is your final product going to look like.
